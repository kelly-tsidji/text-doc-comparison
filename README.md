# text-doc-comparison
This project builds a word representation and document comparison system using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique.
The goal was to develop a program capable of automatically finding relevant and similar text documents. 
I preprocessed the data by removing punctuation, non-English and non-text characters, and unifying the case of the text. This preprocessing step was crucial to generate feature representations of the text, representing strings of words as feature vectors of a common length. 
The project involved working with Shakespeare's sonnet collection and aimed to create a system that could be used for document recommendations in online ebook stores or similar platforms. This project showcased my ability to implement text processing techniques and build meaningful feature representations for text data.
